category,trait,demospongiae
biophysical traits,adult body mass/body size,not large
biophysical traits,biomineral,silicate
biophysical traits,calcium carbonate structure location,no (but has silicious spicules)
biophysical traits,calcium carbonate structure stages,no (but adults and larvae have silicious spicules)
biophysical traits,communication requirement (sound),no
biophysical traits,extreme pressure wave sensitive structures,probably
biophysical traits,flight,no
biophysical traits,"navigation requirements (sound or light, or magnetic)",yes;larval navigation def by light;sound unknown
biophysical traits,respiration structures,filter feeding-used for gas exchange as well as acquisition of nutrients (and also of sperm;in spermcast spawners) and expulsion of waste and of gamates or larvae
breeding/nesting range/number of spawning aggregations (fish),number of sites,na
foraging range,"number of sites, incl. terrestrial wetlands",filter feeders (such as sponges and many other marine inverts) feed from water passing through;so foraging range could actually be enormous
movement,planktonic larval duration (pld),most larvae lecithotrophic;pld<1day
physiological tolerance breadths,salinity,high tolerance to fluctuations in these parameters;which vary substantially in the reef flat habitat of this species
physiological tolerance breadths,sensitivity to wave energy (physical forcing),yes;can lead to fragmentation of adults
physiological tolerance breadths,thermal - sensitivity to heat spikes/heat waves,no
physiological tolerance breadths,thermal - sensitivity to ocean warming - max temps tolerated,30c
r (reproductive traits),age to 1st reproduction/generation time,probably<1;or 1-2yr
r (reproductive traits),can the sex ratio be altered by a stressor?,unknown;probably no
r (reproductive traits),fecundity,100-1000(and asexual repro also possible)
r (reproductive traits),feeding larva (post-hatching metamorphosis),non-feeding larvaemetamorphosis
r (reproductive traits),global population size,unsure;maybe 1-10k
r (reproductive traits),lifetime # reproductive opportunities,100
r (reproductive traits),max age,probably 1-5yrs;although with asexual reproduction could be much longer
r (reproductive traits),parental investment,spermcast spawner (embryos brooded)
r (reproductive traits),post-birth/hatching parental dependence,<1day
r (reproductive traits),reproductive strategy,sexual hermaphrodite;asexual (some demosponges are dioecious)
spatial scale of species,eoo (range),dont know;but would guess<100km2
spatial scale of species,zone,benthic;pelagic
specialisation,air-sea interface,no
specialisation,dependent interspecific interactions,yes
specialisation,extreme diet specialization,no
specialisation,light dependence,well yes;because circadian rhythms entrained by light;with effacts on multiple physiological factors
specialisation,terrestrial and marine life stages,no;marine only
