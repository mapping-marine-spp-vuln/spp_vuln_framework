# spp_vulnerability

## TO DO

- get traits for more species
    - where are the rest of the corals?
    - more fish?
    - extract some values from FishBase and SealifeBase perhaps
    - note these can be gapfilled but more info at spp level = better
- Idea from Mel: Map the difference between maximum level impact (running the analysis with all pressures at high values) and observed impact.  
    - A large difference would indicate regions that have high vulnerability but low impact..which might be good for conservation prioritization.  
    - One complication is constraining certain pressures that aren't global (land-based nutrient pollution will generally not be a problem beyond coastal areas).
    - I have always liked the idea of using this method to identify high risk species based on average global impact (or, similar metric).  
    - It might also be useful to map just these species to see where (and which methods of) conservation might be effective if the goal is protecting vulnerable species.
